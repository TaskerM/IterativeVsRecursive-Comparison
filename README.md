# IterativeVsRecursive-Comparison
This project took a small dataset array and compared Big O processing between iterative and recursive methods.

This was for a computer science course. Using an insert sort method on an array, the code compares the Big O speed
of an iterative parsing of that array versus the recursive speed of the same process.
